Context and Error Boundaries - Advanced React Concept Example
============================================================

This repository contains an example project demonstrating the usage of Context API and Error Boundaries in React. It showcases how to create and use dynamic context to pass data through the component tree, as well as how to handle and gracefully recover from errors using Error Boundaries.

Features
--------

- Dynamic context implementation using React Context API
- Error Boundary component to catch and handle errors
- Example components showcasing the usage of Context and Error Boundaries
- Clear code structure with separate files for each component

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:

> git clone https://github.com/lavkush-maurya/context-errorBoundaries-advance-react-concept-example.git

2. Install the dependencies:
> cd context-errorBoundaries-advance-react-concept-example
> npm install

3. Start the development server:
> npm start


4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

Usage
-----

The repository contains an example of how to implement dynamic context using React Context API and how to use Error Boundaries to gracefully handle errors. It includes the following files:

- `DynamicContext.jsx`: Parent component that provides the context and renders the example components.
- `ChildComponent.jsx`: Example component that consumes the context and displays the data.
- `ErrorBoundary.jsx`: Error Boundary component that catches errors and displays a fallback UI.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to understand and experiment with the concepts of Context and Error Boundaries in React.
